# ML-Project
We chose the [Fake and Real News Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/clmentbisaillon/fake-and-real-news-dataset) for our project. It contains labeled articles categorized as either *fake* or *real*.

We implemented a Logistic Regression classifier to distinguish between fake and real news based on the article content.
